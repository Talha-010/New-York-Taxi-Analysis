# NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data Analysis (January 2023)

This project involves an in-depth analysis of New York City's Yellow Taxi trip data for January 2023. The notebook explores trip patterns, distances, fare amounts, and much more using various data science techniques.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to:
- Load and explore the dataset.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Visualize insights from the data.

## Installation

Before running this notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Additionally, you will need to download the **NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data** from the official [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission website](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) for January 2023 in `.parquet` format.

## Data

The dataset contains various fields related to taxi operations, including:
- **VendorID**: A code indicating the provider associated with the trip record.
- **tpep_pickup_datetime**: Timestamp when the trip began.
- **tpep_dropoff_datetime**: Timestamp when the trip ended.
- **passenger_count**: Number of passengers in the trip.
- **trip_distance**: Distance traveled by the taxi.
- **fare_amount**: Fare for the trip.
- **total_amount**: Total fare paid, including taxes, surcharges, and tips.

## Steps in the Analysis

### 1. Data Loading

We start by loading the January 2023 taxi trip data stored in a `.parquet` file. This format is chosen for its efficiency in handling large datasets.

```python
import pandas as pd
taxi_jan_2023 = pd.read_parquet('yellow_tripdata_2023-01.parquet')
```

### 2. Data Exploration

In this step, we explore the dataset to understand its size, structure, and content. We inspect the shape, column names, and types of the data to ensure everything is as expected.

```python
taxi_jan_2023.shape  # Check the number of rows and columns
taxi_jan_2023.columns  # Display all columns
```

A snapshot of the data is displayed for a better understanding:

| tpep_pickup_datetime | tpep_dropoff_datetime | passenger_count | trip_distance | total_amount |
|----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|
| 2023-01-01 00:32:10  | 2023-01-01 00:40:36   | 1.0             | 0.97          | 14.30        |
| 2023-01-01 00:55:08  | 2023-01-01 01:01:27   | 1.0             | 1.10          | 16.90        |
| 2023-01-01 00:25:04  | 2023-01-01 00:37:49   | 1.0             | 2.51          | 34.90        |

### 3. Data Cleaning

Before proceeding with analysis, it's important to clean the data. This includes:
- Handling missing values.
- Converting data types (e.g., datetime columns).
- Filtering invalid or erroneous data (e.g., trips with zero distance).

```python
taxi_jan_2023.dropna(inplace=True)  # Remove rows with missing values
taxi_jan_2023['tpep_pickup_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(taxi_jan_2023['tpep_pickup_datetime'])
taxi_jan_2023['tpep_dropoff_datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(taxi_jan_2023['tpep_dropoff_datetime'])
```

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this section, we use descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of key variables like trip distances, passenger counts, and fare amounts.

**Trip Distance Distribution**  
We create histograms and box plots to show the distribution of trip distances.

```python
taxi_jan_2023['trip_distance'].hist(bins=50)
```

The plot shows that most trips are within a short distance range (1-2 miles).

**Fare Distribution**  
Similarly, we visualize how taxi fares are distributed across the dataset:

```python
taxi_jan_2023['total_amount'].hist(bins=50)
```

### 5. Visual Insights

Visualizing the data helps uncover trends and patterns. Example plots include:
- **Trip frequency by hour of the day**  
  Showing peak hours of taxi usage.
  
- **Fare amount vs. trip distance**  
  Exploring the relationship between how far people travel and how much they pay.

## Results

Through this analysis, we found key insights such as:
- The majority of trips are short, typically within 1-2 miles.
- Taxi usage peaks in the late evening and early morning hours.
- The relationship between trip distance and fare is generally linear, with exceptions for very short or very long trips.

## Usage

You can run the analysis in this notebook by downloading the dataset and running the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook Main_notebook.ipynb
```

Make sure to update the dataset path if necessary.
